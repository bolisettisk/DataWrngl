# binding
# datasets are combined is by binding them. Unlike the join function, the binding functions do not try to match by a variable, but instead simply combine datasets. If the datasets donâ€™t match by the appropriate dimensions, one obtains an error.

bind_cols(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
# Note that R-base function cbind has the exact same functionality. However, cbind can create different types of objects but bind_cols always produces a data frame.
